        <p>
            Hi, I'm Mikeal Fowler, a dedicated and enthusiastic individual hailing from Halifax, Nova Scotia.
            I currently live in Lower Sackville and work at Halifax Public Libraries, specifically at the Halifax North branch, where I enjoy helping the community access information and resources.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a recent graduate of Sackville High School in 2018, I am now pursuing my passion for technology and development.
            I am enrolled at Dalhousie University in a program called the Matrix Code, where I am learning to become a full-stack developer.
            This journey has introduced me to various programming languages and tools, including Java and iTerm, and I am continuously expanding my skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my free time, I indulge in a variety of hobbies and interests.
            I love playing video games, especially titles like Dragon's Dogma 2, and enjoy watching shows such as 'The Boys,' 'Invincible,' Marvel series, 'The Last of Us,' and 'South Park.'
            My love for all things nerdy extends to Star Wars and Marvel fandoms as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            My personal life is enriched by my family and friends.
            I am proud to have two older sisters, Larissa and Ashley, a younger brother named Larael, and a niece named Winter.
            My close-knit circle of friends includes Javon, Cameron, Randolph, and Hendo, with whom I share many memorable experiences, from hiking adventures to NBA 2K24 marathons.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond my digital and entertainment interests, I have a penchant for working on cars, although I'm still learning the ropes.
            I also enjoy exploring the outdoors, dining out, and savoring good drinks.
            Recently.
        </p>
        <p>
            Driven by a deep curiosity and commitment to growth, I strive to balance my career aspirations with my diverse interests.
            My goal is to excel as a full-stack developer and contribute meaningfully to the tech industry.
            Whether it's through coding projects, community service at the library, or personal endeavors, I am dedicated to making the most of every opportunity that comes my way.
