            Dear Mackenzie,

            I hope you’re doing well. I’ve been reflecting on our time together, and there’s something important I need to say to you. I want to apologize from the bottom of my heart for not being the boyfriend you deserved. I know I failed you in many ways—I didn’t try hard enough, and I didn’t show you the love and care that you deserved.
            
            When you left, it opened my eyes to what I had been blind to all along. Losing you has made me realize how much I took for granted and how I should have been more present, more understanding, and more loving. You showed me, through your absence, what it means to truly care for someone, and I’m deeply sorry that I didn’t learn that lesson sooner.
            
            I can’t change the past, but I want you to know that I’m committed to being better. I’ve realized what I need to do and how I need to act to show love properly, and that’s something I’ll carry with me moving forward. I regret that it took losing you to see things clearly, but please know that your impact on my life has been profound.
            
            Thank you for everything you taught me, even if it was through some hard lessons. I’m truly sorry for the hurt I caused, and I hope one day you can forgive me.
            
            Wishing you all the best,
            
            Mikeal
        </p>
