            Driven by a deep curiosity and commitment to growth, I strive to balance my career aspirations with my diverse interests.
            My goal is to excel as a full-stack developer and contribute meaningfully to the tech industry.
            Whether it's through coding projects, community service at the library, or personal endeavors, I am dedicated to making the most of every opportunity that comes my way.
